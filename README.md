Whorf was created to have low SFB, low distance, to find a place for `y` other than an `iy` column, and to make less use of the bottom left row because it is uncomfortable for me on stagger: you don't need angle mod if you don't use the bottom row ðŸ§ .

Whorf manages to beat most layouts in SFB count and DSFB count while also having a decent amount of rolls, although they are not consistent in direction (in-out ratio is like 0.9 if you care about that).

After being out for a while, the community have made note of the following improvements:
- `hn` swap allows for more natural rolls for both `nd` and `th`
- `fv` swap makes patterns like `'ve` more comfortable

Remember, pinky can anything, and if you use a layout with finger placements the creator didn't intend for you go to hell.
