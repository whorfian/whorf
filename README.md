Whorf was created to have low SFB, low distance, to find a place for `y` other than an `iy` column, and to make less use of the bottom left row because it is uncomfortable for me on stagger: you don't need angle mod if you don't use the bottom row ðŸ§ .

Whorf manages to beat most layouts in SFB count and DSFB count while also having a decent amount of rolls, although they are not consistent in direction (in-out ratio is like 0.9 if you care about that).

After being out for a while, the community have made note of the following improvements:
- `hn` swap allows for more natural rolls for both `nd` and `th`
- `fv` swap makes patterns like `'ve` more comfortable

This version of whorf takes advantage of row stagger and angle mod to keep the keys closer on `y` index. The heatmap for the `t` index is also more concentrated and a better handshape for what qwerty users are used to. This hand shape keeps the right index low most of the time, which will feel normal if you've used qwerty for a long time. Rolls like `nd` are a row jump but feel fine on row stagger. Even issues like `bl` feel more comfortable on this because of stagger. This version also makes `cy` easier to alt finger. A benefit of the flip is also that `eu/ue` and `ao/oa` are easier to alt, but `rl/lr` is difficult (for me) to alt.

Another fun option is to throw in a repeat key! We're doing a lot of optimizing for stagger, and much of the time it's difficult to fit a repeat key into stagger because there's no nearby, extra thumb key to put it on. Well, with this configuration it's easy to just slap one on above `i`. Analyzers will start to complain about all the SFB on `s` because of the punctuation, but nowadays I'm in the camp that we've cared too much about optimizing for punctuation in the past. People normally slow down on punctuation like `.` anyways because they're shifting letters, so it being SFB heavy doesn't really even matter. Enjoy your incredibly low consecutive finger usage, low distance, and high atlernation.

Remember, pinky can anything, and if you use a layout with finger placements the creator didn't intend for you go to hell.
